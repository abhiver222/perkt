#PERKT

##Overview
Developed for HackIllinois Spring 2015, PERKT is a prototype of a security platform that utilizes facial recognition instead of the typical text-based password. Here's the <a href="http://perkt.io">website!</a>

##Usage
This script takes a picture with the webcam and first identifies the faces present. Then it takes these faces and compares them to a directory of authorized faces already loaded within the script. If a match is found, the person is authorized and can move on, however, if the person is not authorized then a security system goes off triggering a rapid firing flashlight and a 4X4X4 led cube. There is a website to complement the implementation of this the PERKT security system with a list of the developers and a video tutorial demonstrating its function.
